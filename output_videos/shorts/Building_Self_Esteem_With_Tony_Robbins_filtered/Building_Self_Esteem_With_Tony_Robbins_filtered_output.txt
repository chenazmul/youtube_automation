"How to Truly Build Self-Esteem | Tony Robbins' Life-Changing Advice"

**Video Description:**

In this insightful video, Tony Robbins dives deep into the true essence of self-esteem and how it is genuinely built. He challenges the common notion that self-esteem can be handed to you through participation trophies or constant praise. Instead, Tony explains that real self-esteem is something you earn through overcoming personal challenges and pushing yourself beyond your limits.

Tony Robbins emphasizes that regardless of external validation, true self-worth comes from within. You may be told your whole life that you're either worthless or perfect, but neither will matter if you don't believe it yourself. It's the difficult tasks you conquer and the personal goals you achieve that build your self-esteem. Watch this video to learn how to harness your inner strength and truly earn your self-respect.
